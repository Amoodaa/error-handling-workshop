## Intro

> "whatever can go wrong, will go wrong." - Capt. Edward A. Murphy, 1949

Before 1949, the saying had actually been around for years. Murphy gave it a name when working on Air Force Project MX981, a project designed to see how much sudden deceleration a person can stand in a crash. The "law" was used successfully in the project to assert good safety measures, by way of focussing on circumventing errors.

# User Perceived Errors

## Request to an unknown path

**Problem:** "Some joker keeps trying to make an invalid request to my server by making a GET request to a *'/lolfail'* path (which I haven't set up to handle)."

This 'joker' may actually be a legitimate user, who heard from a bad friend that the '/lolfail' path to your server returns funny videos upon making a GET request to it.
They keep making a request to this path because their browser window simply doesn't respond ("is it actually loading?"...â†»...), it just hangs and doesn't connect, and they're confused as to whether the issue is related to their wifi.

**Solution:** Set up a case in your router to handle unknown paths, for example;

```javascript
if (validRoutes[request.url]) {
	validRoutes[request.url](req, res);
} else {
	notFound(request, response);
}

const notFound = (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(404, {'content-type' : "text/html"})
  response.end('Your friend was lying to you, this path leads to nowhere')
}
```
